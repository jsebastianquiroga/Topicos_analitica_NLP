        "text = \"he Ferryman by Justin Cronin is a very highly recommended dystopian/speculative science fiction marvel.The idyllic archipelago of Prospera is a socially regimented island state founded by the Designer. Citizens enjoy long fulfilling lives until their next “iteration,” where their personalities reemerge in younger bodies. Proctor Bennett works as a ferryman, which means he assists aging Prosperans to travel to the Nursery, an island where their bodies are restored. All citizens have monitors embedded in their forearms which measures their health. If it fails below 10 percent, it is time to retire.Proctor has always had problems with dreaming, which is not supposed to happen, but now his monitor percentage has been dropping too. When he is called to retire his own father, events go amiss and he receives an enigmatic message from him before getting him onto the ferry. At the same time the support staff for Prospera who all live on the island called the Annex, are now becoming disgruntled and a resistance group known as Arrivalists is growing.At this point hold on tight, set expectations aside, and keep reading because so many unexpected twists and events happen one after another that it is pointless to predict anything. This will be easy to do because the quality of the writing is exceptional and the plot is fast-paced and riveting. Cronin is in perfect control of the plot and his characters so just keep reading. I promise you\"\n",

And I rarely summarize fiction plots, mainly because I think it unfair to the author - there are plenty of people who do for those on the hunt, and there is almost always an extra teaser blurb somewhere - and I think it unfair to the reader who, like me, dislikes spoilers. In a rare confluence of my requests, I have two fiction ARCS, each with a partial style that I initially found offputting, and yet each eventually drew me in. (Partial because it wasn't the main style.) In this case, there were some present tense segments that mildly jar the reader away from the narrative, although, the Prologue opens with some. Regardless, I adapted and as said, it drew me in. The pacing was a slow acceleration as things unfold until it became frenetic in the last quarter. I did predict a couple of major things, both of which turned out true, but there are still many twists and turns in this engaging story. it went from reluctant to get into to 'can't put it down' (the other ARC got bumped).\"\n",
